# Brain Machine Interface Challenge
Competition in the BMI course that I attended during my MSc Biomedical Engineering. The goal was to design a neural decoder to drive a hypothetical prosthetic device. 

I was provided with spike trains recorded from a monkey's brain, as it repeatedly performs an arm movement task. The algorithm was expected to estimate, from these data, the precise trajectory of the monkey's hand as it reaches for the target.

This is a continuous estimation task. Over the course of each spike train, our team had to estimate the X & Y
position of the monkey's hand at each moment in time. Moreover, the decoder had to be causal, which means that it could not use information from the future to estimate the position of the hand in the present.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
